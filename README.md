# Tsunami-vs-Non-Tsunami-Earthquakes
🌊 Tsunami vs Non-Tsunami Earthquakes Analysis

This project analyzes the seismic characteristics of tsunami and non-tsunami earthquakes from 2001–2022 using Python.

Key Objectives:

Compare magnitude, depth, and energy release patterns

Identify regions with high tsunami potential

Use visualizations (box plots, histograms, and heatmaps) for comparative analysis

Tools & Libraries Used:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Insights:

Tsunami events generally occur at shallower depths and higher magnitudes

Certain regions show repeated high-risk patterns over time
